# UELibnoise
Porting of the C++ library "libnoise" to a plugin compatible with Unreal Engine 5.3.1 or later.

This plugin adds a blueprint-friendly way to implement the libnoise library into Unreal Engine. Every module has been added as a blueprint node (type is UUELibnoiseModule) and can quickly generate and layer/combine noise modules.

This plugins is still WIP, but is free to use under the MIT license. Keep in mind that properties can change significantly in future updates.
